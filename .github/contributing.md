# Contributing to wger

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

Our goal is to build an awesome and flexible fitness and nutrition manager,
along with a comprehensive list of exercises and ingredients, all released
under a free license.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to wger
which is hosted in the wger-project Organization on GitHub.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. As everywhere in life, use your
best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document
in a pull request.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to start contributing:

When contributing to the Wger project, it is good practice to create your own branch.
This creates an environment for your work that is isolated from the master branch.
To be able to do so, see Step 8 of the link below.

## Questions
Are you just using the software and have a question or improvement?

* Ask on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/rPWFv6W)
* or just [open an issue](https://github.com/wger-project/wger/issues)

## Issues
Describe the problem as well as you can. If useful, include any screenshots,
server logs or exceptions that you have access to and think might be relevant.
Include the git SHA1 if you have installed from source. If it's an enhancement,
describe a use-case or similar.

## Pull Requests
You want to contribute code? Awesome! Here are some tips:

* Make sure the tests are running (``python3 manage.py test``)...
* ... and if you write new code, write new tests
* Your code will be automatically linted and formatted with yapf and isort
  when it's merged.
* You can expect a response from a maintainer within a week, if you
haven‚Äôt heard anything by then, feel free to ping the thread.

You want to submit a Pull Request? See Step 12 of this guide to see how you can
start a pull request: https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/#:~:text=Step%2012%3A%20Begin%20the%20pull%20request.
